###Swear O Meter written in Angular JS

This is a clone of the SwearOMeter I've written before in both [JQuery](https://github.com/madole/twitter-fuckometer) and [ReactJS](https://github.com/madole/SwearOMeter), but this is written in AngularJS.
 
It uses my [Twitter Swear API](https://github.com/madole/twitterSwearAPI) which is a NodeJS & Express application hosted on [heroku](http://afternoon-citadel-9782.herokuapp.com)

I've used [Yeoman Angular Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) to scaffold the Angular project.


To get up and running, clone the repo. 

    npm install
    
    grunt
    
    grunt serve
    
    
This should open a browser window at http://localhost:9000 with liveReload enabled so you can work in your IDE and
see the changes reflected in your browser almost immediately.
